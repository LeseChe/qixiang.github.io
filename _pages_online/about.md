I am Qixiang Chen, and I am currently a 3rd-year undergraduate student studying for a Bachelor of Advanced Computing degree, majoring in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at ANU under supervision of [Dr. Lei Wang](https://leiwangr.github.io/) (ANU).

I am curious about AI that shapes the world and the universe, and apply that curiosity to discover new things. 

I have learnt to deal efficiently with complex projects in a time efficient manner. I have also learnt to work in a team and to communicate effectively with others. I am a quick learner and I am always eager to learn new things.
