I am Qixiang Chen, and I am currently a 3rd-year undergraduate student studying for a Bachelor of Advanced Computing degree, majoring in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at ANU under supervision of [Dr. Lei Wang](https://leiwangr.github.io/) (ANU).

I am curious about AI that shapes the world and the universe, and apply that curiosity to discover new things. I'm currently focusing on using machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning to tackle cool challenges in videos. It's all about finding interesting ways to solve problems with these technologies.

I have learnt to deal efficiently with complex projects in a time efficient manner. Being a quick learner, I'm always enthusiastic about exploring and acquiring new knowledge.
