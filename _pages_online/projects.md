## Industry Projects
  - **Robust anomaly detection in human-centric videos**
    - **Duration:** 01/2024 - 06/2024
    - **Research Grant:** The NCI National AI Flagship Merit Allocation Scheme.

## Academic Projects
  - **Action Recognition in Videos**
    - **Duration:** Dec 2023 - Present

## Completed Projects

- **Vehicle Image Translation: Adapting Synthetic Styles to Real-World Scenarios**
  - **Duration:** Semester 2, 2023
  - **Objective:** This project focuses on the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically CycleGAN, for the purpose of image-to-image translation. The goal is to stylistically adapt vehicle images from the synthetic Vehicle-X dataset to resemble those in the real-world VeRi dataset, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of vehicle recognition algorithms.
  - **Achievements:**
    - Successfully trained a CycleGAN model to transform the style of Vehicle-X images to align with VeRi dataset aesthetics.
    - Improved the domain adaptation for vehicle recognition tasks in varied lighting and environmental conditions.
